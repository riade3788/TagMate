TagMate 2 is a desktop application designed to help you organize your collection of digital art files, specifically those related to Stable Diffusion models.

What does it do?

TagMate 2 scans a folder filled with Stable Diffusion model files and related information.
It then categorizes and sorts these files based on user-defined tags and criteria.
You can set up TagMate 2 to sort your files based on factors like:
Model Type (e.g., Character, Vehicle, etc.)
NSFW Status (appropriate or not for work)
The SD version used to create the model (applicable for some models)
Base Model used to create the model (applicable for some models)
TagMate 2 can also rename your files to make them easier to identify.
Benefits of Using TagMate 2:

Saves you time and effort by automatically organizing your Stable Diffusion model files.
Makes it easier to find the specific models you're looking for by browsing through a well-organized structure.
How to Use TagMate 2:

Download and Install: (These instructions will likely depend on your operating system. You can add specific instructions for common operating systems here.)
Open TagMate 2
Select the Folder Containing Your Models: Use the "Browse" button next to "Input Folder" to choose the folder where your Stable Diffusion models are stored.
Choose an Output Folder: Use the "Browse" button next to "Output Folder" to choose where you want the organized files to be saved. TagMate 2 won't modify the original files in the input folder.
Customize Sorting (Optional):
TagMate 2 lets you define which criteria you want to use for sorting your files. Play around with the checkboxes under "Sort by" to see how they affect the organization.
You can also create custom tags to categorize your models by specific details. Click "Add Tag" to create a new tag and use the listbox to manage your tags.
Start Categorization: Click the "Start Categorization" button to begin sorting your files based on your chosen settings. TagMate 2 will display a message indicating how many files were processed.
Additional Notes:

TagMate 2 creates a log file to track any changes made during the sorting process. In case you need to undo the organization, you can use the "Rollback" button.
You can configure TagMate 2 to remember the folders you've used and your preferred sorting options for future use.
